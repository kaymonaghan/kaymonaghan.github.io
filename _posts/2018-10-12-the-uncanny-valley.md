As we continued reading Speak and discussing the fine (?) line between robot and human, I became more curious about the concept of the uncanny valley. I wanted to learn more about this phenomenon from a psychological standpoint: why do humans react so negatively to things that are almost human but a little bit off? And how do people’s perceptions of the almost-human vary? In Speak, Gaby is bothered by MARY3’s methods of communication, which would be almost indistinguishable from a human’s if MARY3 herself hadn’t told Gaby how she chooses voices and words. However, she isn’t bothered by the babybots conceptually, and though we don’t know exactly how they look, I would have to imagine that they are rather humanoid, and we know that they can move.

An [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00864) in the journal Scientific Reports, published in 2012 by Roger K. Moore discusses the topic of the uncanny valley. First, the article defines the uncanny valley as, “the observation that near-human artifacts can engender strong negative emotions in an observer.” Moore’s article emphasizes the importance of the difference between the target category of the object and the background category of the object. In the example of a robot that approaches humanness, the target category would be human, while the background category would be non-human. When these two categories intersect and are too close, too similar, then things get a little uncomfortable. Basically, as the human and non-human blur together, people have more negative reactions.

Something else interesting is that apparently, the more the object moves, the deeper the uncanny valley gets, meaning the more uncomfortable a person would be observing the object. It seems then, that the more human attributes a nonhuman object has, the more uncanny it gets: it isn’t just about its motionless visual exterior, but if its movements have something “off” about them as well, that contributes to the effect even more.

Personally, I found that none of the CGI/animation image results I stumbled upon for uncanny valley made me uncomfortable at all, whereas almost-human robots only made me uncomfortable if they were moving. I have to wonder what factors influence how certain things affect different people. Other people find the CGI uncomfortable, though. Is our difference in perception due to the fact that I have had a lot of exposure to CGI and animation, where other people haven’t? Was this phenomenon stronger when Polar Express first came out in 2004, for example, when people weren’t as used to effects like this? 

The graph below puts the conductor from the movie near the bottom of the uncanny valley, which would mark it as one of the most uncomfortable or uncanny things. A real person is obviously not going to evoke these feelings, but I wonder how this graph changes from person to person. A stick figure and other 2D characters seem not to trigger this emotional response for the majority of people, either.

This made me curious about the fact that the uncanny valley seems largely, if not entirely, about visual perception. Whether it’s a stationary humanoid object or a moving one, it can inspire these emotions in people. However, other human attributes seem to be missing; perhaps they don’t matter as much, if at all?

It doesn’t seem that the voice of a robot makes people uncomfortable. Why are we so okay with Amazon’s Alexa, when she hardly sounds like a robot at all? To me, her voice is almost indistinguishable from the voice of a real human’s for most people. What if a humanoid robot smelled like your closest loved one? Would that be uncomfortable? Some people talk to robots that pass the Turing test, and they can’t tell them apart from a human. I have to wonder what about the visual aspects of these robots is so powerful, considering it’s perhaps more threatening that their “mental” processes mimic a human’s as well. In theory, I feel like that should make me feel more uncomfortable… but it doesn’t.
