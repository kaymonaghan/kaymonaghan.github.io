TikTok: What You‚Äôd Never Do In Person

When reading [The Great LOLCat Massacre by Elyse Graham](https://www.publicbooks.org/the-great-lolcat-massacre/), what stuck out to me the most were some of Ethan Zuckerman‚Äôs comments about the information that we as people share with each other online. For context, Zuckerman stated that, in contrast to the wide range of emotions that cats are able to express, ‚Äúdogs would never work for the multivalent, generically complex messages we often share online.‚Äù As the director of the Center for Civic Media in MIT‚Äôs Media Lab, he researches how people interact with others online, and has a lot of familiarity with the particular ways that people express themselves on the internet, and even says that ‚Äúwe often use internet genres to share terrible thoughts that we would never share in person.‚Äù 

His remarks piqued my own interest in the particular forms of media that people use to express themselves online, especially their darker, more morbid thoughts. In class, we discussed the recent rise of the use of self-deprecating memes and humor on the internet. I have noticed a lot of this very self-deprecating humor, if we really want to call it humor, on an app that has gained a lot of popularity recently: TikTok. Essentially, this app allows users to record videos of themselves lip syncing to popular music, dialogue from movies, and even perform ‚Äúduets‚Äù with other users by stitching two videos together side-by-side.

But of course, the app doesn‚Äôt just contain lip syncing, and a lot of times, the video that someone adds to another‚Äôs video as a ‚Äúduet‚Äù ends up being a way to bully the other user. There are countless compilations uploaded to YouTube of ‚Äúcringey‚Äù TikToks, and the TikToks that are made fun of in particular are usually created by children. So a good way of expressing why people view them as ‚Äúcringey‚Äù is that they evoke similar feelings in the audience that a bunch of elementary school kids doing Fortnite dances would evoke. Kids having fun is cringey and laughable apparently, and TikTok really highlights this current trend.

In this example, the user pictured on the left has added her video to the original on the right, which includes two young boys lip syncing to a harmless song. The user on the left is pouring bleach into a cup, implying that she has suicidal ideation as a result of seeing the boys singing, as if their video is so cringey and bothersome that she would feel inclined to hurt herself over it. This connects back to Zuckerberg‚Äôs comment that we use the internet to express darker things that we‚Äôd never express to someone in person: most likely, the girl on the left wouldn‚Äôt go up to these significantly younger teen boys and tell them how horrible and embarrassing they are. But she‚Äôs expressing all that and more here by appending her own short video to theirs, not only making light of suicidal thoughts but also just what I would consider textbook bullying.

There are countless examples of similar duets that are uploaded to the application. I find that it seems far less monitored than other platforms, and I‚Äôm shocked that content like this remains on the site, at least long enough to gain popularity and be compiled into long videos like the one linked above. The majority of them draw their humor from bullying oneself or others, often on the basis of ‚Äúcringe.‚Äù [TikTok‚Äôs Global Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/policies/) make it clear that this content is theoretically **not** allowed, and yet so many videos that use not only bullying, but even *hate speech* as their comedic core remain on the app, or accessible elsewhere. 

It doesn‚Äôt seem to be sticking that the way one conducts oneself online *should not* differ so greatly from how one conducts oneself in person. I feel like this message has been lost on people no matter how many times it has been widely addressed on the internet since I personally began using the internet. Is there anything that can be done about the changing trends of cyberbullying, or are they moving too fast to address? How can we hold people accountable for their actions? 

Sometimes I worry that parents aren‚Äôt going to be able to tell the difference between joking and bullying, or the difference between lighthearted self-deprecation and seriously dangerous thoughts. How can we introduce healthier methods of self-expression to these impressionable young kids?
