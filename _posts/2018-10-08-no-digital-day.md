I engaged in a “No Digital Day” on September 29th, 2018. I refrained as much as possible from using any technology that wouldn’t have existed in the year 1992. I thought that this would be an interesting challenge for myself, and I scheduled it for a day that I thought it would be particularly challenging for me. In the morning, I was traveling from Boston to my hometown of Plymouth, where I attended my goddaughter’s birthday party. Normally this trip takes about an hour and a half, but because of weekend changes to the MBTA, it took even longer. Instead of being able to ride straight from Boston to my home town, I had to take another train to North Quincy, where I had to wait for a bus that brought me to Braintree. There, I was finally able to switch onto the commuter rail train that brought me to my hometown. This is important to note because I had to endure an entire extra hour of avoiding my technology: normally I listen to music on my phone, browse the web, and message friends to pass the time on the train. This time I couldn’t even do that. 

My only saving grace was that I’d brought a book I was reading for my Modern Bestsellers class. If I hadn’t brought that book, I likely would have tried to fall asleep to no avail, considering all of the connections on this journey. Even while reading the book, I found myself wanting to check my phone every few minutes towards the beginning of my journey. Once I settled into my reading more, I still wanted to check my phone at the end of each chapter that I finished. This made my struggles with reading very apparent: I don’t like reading on a screen, and I try to avoid it because I’ve noticed that my eyesight has gotten significantly worse over the past few years. But even reading on paper has become more difficult for me, and though I can’t describe all of the reasons why, I know that the instant gratification of the internet has played a big role in my inability to focus on reading for long periods of time. Luckily the book was able to distract me well enough from my phone not to look at it, but I did want to very often over the course of the journey home. I did have to use my phone to call my mother once I got off the train so she knew to pick me up, but that was sort of permissible for 1992.

When we got to the birthday party, I was spending a lot of time with my family and didn’t have a lot of desire to look at my phone at first. The only technology in use at the house was the television, which was also a thing in 1992 so that was fine, but I wasn’t watching it a lot anyway. I’m a very introverted person and a lot of my more distant family members don’t seem to understand or accept that all the time, so after a while of talking with them about my life, I got antsy. Usually I’d go into a different room or go outside for a bit and casually browse on my phone, but I couldn’t do that so I just sort of sat there and dealt with it, then got some food (people can’t talk as much when they’re eating). I’m really not that into family parties, especially parties for four-year-olds where there’s nothing to do that’s particularly interesting to me. I was pleasantly surprised with how little I actually wanted to look at my phone at the party considering how generally uninterested I was in it: maybe I had gotten a little bit used to it during the commute.

After the party, my immediate family went to eat at our favorite restaurant. Luckily enough for this project, I actually don’t ever get cell service at the restaurant, and seemed to have already conditioned myself not to even bother looking at my phone. The only thing of note that happened here is that I had to catch a train at a certain time, so I was sometimes tempted to look at my phone for the time. In the end, I just had to trust that my parents knew when to leave so that I’d make it to the train station on time. Otherwise, my little brother would sometimes attempt to show me something he was playing on my stepfather’s phone, but I had to tell him that I was doing a “no phones” day so that he’d understand why I couldn’t look instead of  feeling like I was ignoring him. 

On the ride home, it was more difficult not to look at my phone but I persevered anyway. The long day combined with the long train ride made it hard, but somehow I was able to do it. Reflection upon the experience, I don’t necessarily think I would do it again, or at least not as strictly. If I had a reasonable excuse not to, it would be that I was going camping or doing something that made the use of technology pointless anyway. I find that quitting things cold turkey so to speak isn’t very easy for me, and it’s not a fun way to improve my life. The same goes for eating and other health habits: making small sustainable changes is more impactful over long periods of time for me, and I wouldn’t want to cut out technology entirely unless there was good reason to. There were a lot of benefits of it: I read a book, I talked to family more than I might of otherwise, and I wasn’t having many “withdrawals,” but whether or not I do something like this again would depend on how I think it would or wouldn’t enrich a particular experience to do so. 

I would say that I was pleasantly surprised overall with my lack of dependence on technology, at least for this day. I think that this would have been a lot more difficult to accomplish if I had just been holed up in my dorm room all day long, with nothing external to engage my brain. I had a lot of people to talk to, a book to read, and food to eat. Perhaps these distractions are the only reason that I was able to do this as easily as I was, but it was still quite a feat and I didn’t necessarily expect it. The most interesting thing that I noticed was definitely my inability to focus on reading a book: as I said before, it took a few chapters for me to really get into the book, and I often found that I had to re-read paragraphs or entire pages that my brain didn’t fully process the first time. I assume that this is due in part to the fact that I don’t read anything quite as long on the internet. I may technically read a lot of words, but my attention span isn’t as good as it used to be. Overall, this was an interesting experience and I wouldn’t mind trying it again, if the choice made sense in the context of what I was doing for that day.
